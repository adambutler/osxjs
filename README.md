# Build OS X with Javascript

Since OS X Yosemite was launched it's possible to build native applictions with JavaScript. In March 2015 I did a [Bristol JS](http://bristoljs.org
talk on build OS X applications with JavaScript. In this repo you will find the code examples which include the same simple
app (JavaScript to CoffeeScript converter) built with -

- Natively with JavaScript
- Node.js
- nw.js
- Alfred Workflows

As a bonus there is also the code for building the app natively with Swift.
